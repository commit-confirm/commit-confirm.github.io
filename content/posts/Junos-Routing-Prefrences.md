This is a short post on juniper default route prefrences for specific protcols seen in the routing table. Routes with a lower prefrence are preferred over higher.

#### **Notes:**

* In Junos EBGP routes are always perfered of IBGP routes despite the fact they both have the same prefrence of 170.
* System routes and Kernel routes appear to be obsolete (need to verify).
