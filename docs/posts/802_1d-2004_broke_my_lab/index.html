        <p>Okay so slightly misleading title as 802.1D-2004 didn&rsquo;t actually break my lab but it did cause a bit of head scratching as to why my lab wasn&rsquo;t working as expected.</p>

<p>To summarise, I wanted to view all RSTP packets exchange in a small three switch topology. I didn&rsquo;t want to set up loads of port mirroring so I thought it would be best to create a LAB that connecting three Juniper vQFXs together through a single linux node with three bridges for each &lsquo;physical connection&rsquo;; this would give me a single place to capture all traffic.</p>

<p>So an hour later (20 minute vQFX boot time = yay) I had configured very basic vQFXs to allow LLDP on all interfaces and enabled bridging on the Linux box. I was sure that I had configured Linux correctly as I had done this before but I wasn&rsquo;t seeing LLDP on either switch. After some captures on the Linux box I noticed DHCP traffic was making it to the bridg interface but LLDP wasn&rsquo;t getting past the two physical interfaces. The screenshot below shows first DHCP on br1 and then LLDP on eth0.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/2019/01/capture.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/2019/01/capture.png" width="720" ></a></div>

<p>After some looking around I found an explanation and fix (<a href="https://thenetworkway.wordpress.com/2016/01/04/lldp-traffic-and-linux-bridges/">Shout-out</a>). To summarise LLDP packets weren&rsquo;t being forwarded because any Bridge should if following standards drop certain traffic as those destination MAC addresses are never intended to leave a LAN segment, and since bridges bridge LAN segments it makes sense that my LLDP packets were being dropped at the linux box.</p>

<p>However this was a lab and not a LAN, so I quickly disabled this function after which lo and behold LLDP packets now appeared in my br1 capture.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/2019/01/capture2.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/2019/01/capture2.png" width="720" ></a></div>

<p>I knew my next problem would likely be that I would have to do something similar to allow RSTP across br1 however as the capture shows this was already happening thanks to enabling LLDP. After having a very quick look into why this was, it turns out both LLDP and RSTP destination mac addresses were in the same restriction.</p>

<p>STP BPDU frames are sent to 01:80:c2:00:00:00 <br >
LLDP Frames are sent to     01:80:c2:00:00:0E</p>

<p>Both of these addresses are covered by the reserved addresses list defined in 802.1D-2004 as shown below. And that is how the IEEE broke my lab, which is fair considering this standard is instrumental in how LANs actually work.</p>

<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll follow up in a couple of days with the lab and configurations used.</p>
