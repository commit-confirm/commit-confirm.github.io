      <description>First draft notes, likely to be messy/missing information IS-IS or Intermediate System to Intermediate System is an exam objective in the JNCIS-ENT curriculum and a routing protocol I had never actually come across before. At the time when I studied the CCNA and CCNP IS-IS was mentioned but never looked at in detail, this may have changed by now.
The interesting thing about IS-IS is that was inteded to superceed OSPF once the OSI model became widely adopted.</description>
