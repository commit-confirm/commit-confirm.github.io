      <description>Okay so slightly misleading title as 802.1D-2004 didn&amp;rsquo;t actually break my lab but it did cause a bit of head scratching as to why my lab wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as expected.
To summarise, I wanted to view all RSTP packets exchange in a small three switch topology. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to set up loads of port mirroring so I thought it would be best to create a LAB that connecting three Juniper vQFXs together through a single linux node with three bridges for each &amp;lsquo;physical connection&amp;rsquo;; this would give me a single place to capture all traffic.</description>
