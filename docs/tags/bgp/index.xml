      <description>This post will take a quick look into the BGP Finite State model.
IDLE: This is the first state and essentially means a session is inactive waiting for a start event which can be manual or automatic. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to look into Junipers definitions of a start event.
Connect: After a start event BGP will try to establish a TCP connection. A session will remain in the Connect state until either a TCP session is formed or the TCP handshake failed.</description>
